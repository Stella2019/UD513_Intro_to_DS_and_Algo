Sorting techniques can be tricky—sometimes the best way to understand them is to watch a visual of a sorting algorithm in action again and again. When I was first learning sorting, I used to check out the Wikipedia page for each sort. There's normally some colorful illustration near the top, then a GIF showing the sort in action. There are plenty of other visualizations on the World Wide Web—take the time to look around if you need it!


If you were to perform a bubble sort on the following array, what would the third iteration look like
(i.e. after bubbling all the way up 3 times)?

[ 21, 4, 1, 3, 9, 20, 25, 6, 21, 14 ]

-> bubble 1st time

[ 4, 1, 3, 9, 20, 21, 6, 21, 14, 25 ]
                                  v
25 is fixed as largest element

-> buble 2nd time

[ 1, 3, 4, 9, 20, 6, 21, 14, 21, 25 ]
			     v
21 is fixed as second largest element

-> bubble 3rd time

[ 1, 3, 4, 9, 6, 20, 14, 21, 21, 25]
			 v
another 21 is fixed as third largest element
