Sorting is pretty tedious—take a break and check out this comic inspired by merge sort.

You can learn more about merge sort, as well as see many more visualizations, in the online Algorithms textbook. This book is often nice for a more in-depth analysis of topics, but beware—all of the examples are in Java! For merge sort, it's particularly worth reading up on top-down and bottom-up merge sort.


If you were to perform a merge sort on the following awway, which is possibility for what the second iteration might look like (i.e. after bubbling all the way up 2 times)

21 4 1 3 9 20 25
-> divide
[ 21 ] [ 4 ] [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 9 ] [ 20 ] [ 25 ]

-> merge 1st time
[ 21 ] [ 1, 4 ] [ 3, 9 ] [ 20, 25 ]

-> merge 2nd time
[ 1, 4 , 21 ] [ 3, 9, 20, 25]
