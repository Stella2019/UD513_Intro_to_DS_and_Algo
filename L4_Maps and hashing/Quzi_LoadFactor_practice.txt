One of your coworkers comes to you with a hash function that divides a group of value by 100,
and uses the remainder as a key.

The value are 100 numbers that are all multiples of 5

Load factor 
= number of entries / number of slots 
= 100 / 100 
= 1 
= 100 %


What number would you recommend his function to devide by rather than 100 to speed it up ?

107
because 107 is coprime with 5, this property reduces the probability of collision.

In addition, 107 is larger than the total number of entries, this guarantees that load factor would be < 100%
